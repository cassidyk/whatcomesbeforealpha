Version 0.1
===========
This book will be structured as a series of ICA's which will help you create a sandbox to play in. It is written with the assumption you will be running as root from an Archlinux Live CD.

ICA's will be cumulative in the sense that previous ICA configurations may need to be completed first.

Layout of the assignments is still in Beta so feedback is appreciated.

| Shell Variables |

| Variables are assigned here. Copy and paste into your script |

```
This is a script that will run with the values set above
```
Values have been tested to work at the command line, but there may be some issues if they are copied into a script and then the script is run. Please report any issues you encounter as eventually everything will need to run from a script.

Exercises might be included at the bottom of an ICA. Solutions should be automated where possible, and clearly marked what needs to be done manually so they can be improved.

### Exercises ###
* Create a submission box for scripts
