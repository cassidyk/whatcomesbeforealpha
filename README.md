Version 0.1
===========
This book is structured as a series of assignments which will guide exploritory system building. This will be accomplished by first creating an enviroment in which to build and then outling the use of a few building blocks.

An assignment may end with some exercises to complete which will extend your toolkit for building new systems. Exercises should be completed in similar form as assignments for easy import into scripts. Any manual tasks should be clearly marked for future iterations.

Assignments are written for BASH running within an Archlinux LiveCD.

#### Assignment Format ####

| BASH Code |
| -- |
| This table includes variable code. It is to be copied into your script and modified as needed |
```
This block represents a series of BASH commands.

All code can be run using the variable table located above it. Should any manual steps be required
    They will be spelt out in an indented subsection
```

`This block represents a single BASH command` # Variables may need to be specified

All blocks have been tested at a command line, but some issues may arise if they are run in a script and then the script is run. Please report any issues and fixes so that all code will run in a script.

Exercises might be included at the bottom of an ICA. Solutions should be automated where possible, and clearly marked what needs to be done manually so they can be improved.

#### Exercises ####
* Create a submission box for exercises
* Create Live CD builder
